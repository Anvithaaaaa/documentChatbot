Within the vast expanse of computerized language processing, a revolutionary entity known as Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emerged, wielding immense power in its capacity to comprehend intricate linguistic patterns and conjure coherent
and contextually fitting responses. Large language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that have emerged as
powerful tools for a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and question-answering.
This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs, including their history, architecture, training methods, applications,
and challenges. The paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of generative AI and the architecture of generative pretrained transformers (GPT). It then provides an overview of the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, and the different training
methods that have been used to train them. The paper then discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including medical,
education, finance, and engineering. It also discusses how LLMs are shaping the future of AI and how they can be used to solve
real-world problems. The paper then discusses the challenges associated with deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios, including
ethical considerations, model biases, interpretability, and computational resource requirements. It also highlights techniques for
enhancing the robustness and controllability of LLMs and addressing bias, fairness, and generation quality issues. Finally, the
paper concludes by highlighting the future of LLM research and the challenges that need to be addressed in order to make LLMs
more reliable and useful. This survey paper is intended to provide researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts with a comprehensive
understanding of LLMs, their evolution, applications, and challenges. By consolidating the state-of-the-art knowledge in the field,
this survey serves as a valuable resource for further advancements in the development and utilization of LLMs for a wide range
of real-world applications. T
